Chose one video or image for every day of your life (or maybe your cat's life, we are not judging) and combine them to a video.
Powered by ffmpeg and electron and inspired by the android app _1-Second-Everyday_ but for free, open source, and on the desktop.

## Help Wanted!

This is currently a one-man-show and this man doesn't have UX/UI skill, no Mac and hates to fire up
Windows. I could really need some help in those areas. And everywhere else, to be honest.
