# Version 0.3.4 - The illusion of safety

Sometimes, things go absolutely horribly wrong. Let's try and catch at least
the most obvious errors.

### Features
* Find missing files before rendering and warning the user about that
* Much more logging, so in case things go south, we at least have a chance of finding the issue

### Internals
* Moving away from momentjs to dayjs
