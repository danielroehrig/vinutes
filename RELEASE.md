# Version 0.3.3 - Going slow, Steam Summer Sale, Gimme a Break

I will change this when I'm not that tired. Definitely. Possibly.

### Features
* Use system language, if that's one of the TWO languages I currently support
* Logging in renderer thread
* Catch media files that are not supported when trying to insert them into the timeline

### Internals
* Remove the fileTypeCategory catastrophe of a function from the DailyMedia class
* Updated almost all dependencies like electron 11
