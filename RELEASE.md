# Version 0.2.5 - I am Prrrrutty!

Focusing a bit on the design for a bit. As good as I can.
### Functionality

### UI

 * Hide menu bar
 * Enable SASS and change the primary color
 * Change the preferences menu from router link to sidebar component
 * Use buefy navbar instead of bulma's
 * Make the timestamp watermark smaller
 * An image viewer for those days when you only had an image but not a video available

### Bugfixes
 * Clicking on an image caused a very confused video player to appear

### Internals
 * No more vue router
 * Use [buefy](https://buefy.org)
 * Bump electron to version 9.4

### Platforms
